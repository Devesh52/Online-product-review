Good Read for Mythic lovers","Just Finished and diving straight into the review with my thoughts still fresh. Harappa gets an extra star for Vineet’s way of blending history, mythology, religion and crime. While I did enjoy the pages for its way of drawing me into the story of primitive metropolitan and its enlightenment, it also had me shaking my head in incredulity over some choices on characterization. Harappa is one of the book that should be acquainted in your TBR list.Count OnWhat should you count on from Harappa?. Harappa, Curse of the blood river is a modern day mythic thriller. It affirms adventure, hazards, quest, exploit and fantasy. Readers who love the conception of mythological seeks will surely find Harappa as a good read.Story As It GoesVidyut, an entrepreneur from Delhi summoned by his dying ancestor from Khasi. Where in the other part, a world’s most powerful religious institution in Rome is flustered by Vidyut and assigns Europe’s dreaded crime lord to assassinate him during his visit to Banaras.The story gets involved with two timeline parallely.Timeline A – 2017 AD Delhi, where Vidyut visits his great Grand Father, The old Brahmin chieftain of the Dev-Raakshasa Matth. And the story of assassins dreaded to kill vidyut.Timeline B – 1700 BCE Harappa – This part deals with the magnificent city in the banks of mighty Saraswathi river. Most part of this ancient story worked on treachery, taantric, exorcism and bloodshed on Vivasvan Pujari.What binds Banaras, Rome, Goa and Harappa is what Harappa is all about.Writing StyleVineet has some admirable ways to keep the reader in his grip. I love the way he handled most of the sub-characters. Vineet however, seemed to be attentive of the reality and has taken care to not exaggerate it.The author fastens together the elements of mythology, ancient rituals in an uncomplicated style. The Harappa is a perfect indian version of Dan Brown’s series.ClimaxClimax is what dissapointed me a lot. It took me close to 20 days to finish this book, only to find it ends with a cliff-hanger. Another disspointment is the unnecessary usage of ‘half human half god’ phrase every other page which ultimately didn’t add anything to the story.Apart from these shortcomings the writing was actually good, the proposition of this plot was rather interesting. Could have easily cut short some 100 pages with unrelated information.The Final VerdictFast-paced, lots of action, could do with another round of editing as a few errors, but a pretty accurate portrayal of a Modern-Mythical day story.PLOT: 7/10CHARACTERS: 7.1/10WRITING STYLE: 7.3/10CLIMAX: 6/10ENTERTAINMENT QUOTIENT: 6.5/10",Reviewed in India on 9 August 2018

A decent attempt, that could have been better.","After the success of The Shiva trilogy, many readers are moving towards mythology. I personally like Mythology and the way Amish treats his books. I heard a few positive reviews about this book. The blurb and the cover further intrigued me in reading to see what ‘Harappa- Curse of the Blood River’ brings forth.  The title is apt and not many authors would have tried writing a historical-mythological-fantasy fiction that would need a lot of research. This is a good attempt by Vineet Bajpai.The book revolves between 1700 BC and 2017 AD. The story is based on Vivasvan Pujari and Vidyut Shastri born in different eras, but something connects them. The story interlinks the two eras and the two characters. A phone call at an odd hour makes Vidyut travel to Kashi/ Banaras to see his dying great grandfather. There is a secret that he has kept all his life- a secret that changed the fate of mankind many years back.Positives:• The story moves brilliantly between the two eras and makes it an interesting read.• It will give you a glimpse of three places or cultures- Rome, Banaras and Harappa.• The genre is a mix of history, occult and thriller- if you like these, you can give this book a try.• The plot is good, the character sketch for all the characters is well thought through. I personally liked the way Vivasvan Pujari’s character has been drawn and the culture of Harappa has been shared. The choice of words and expressions do justice to both.Negatives:• The narration is slow paced; it didn’t need 314 pages for this plot.• There are a few grammatical errors and repetition of information like ‘Half Human, Half God’ on almost every other page.• The secret was revealed in the beginning so that was a low point for me.• The conversation between the Protagonist- Vidyut and his wife Damini has not been handled well. Usage of words like yaa and baby are un-relatable.Overall, a book you can pick up for the storyline.My ratings:• Title: 5/5• Cover: 4/5• Blurb: 4/5• Characterization: 4/5• Plot: 4/5• Writing and Presentation: 3/5• Overall Rating: 3/5",Reviewed in India on 9 November 2017

Historically Visual Treat: Harappa - Curse of the Blood River by Vineet Bajpai","When it comes to history, we always love to know what happened in the past and draw inspirations positively to live the present. Sometimes, we also say history repeats itself. It does, but we get to know the technique to deal with it in a better way from the example of the past.Vineet Bajpai crafts his story in a very interesting and dear historical setting atleast to me, the setting is of great importance and liking as I have learnt of it in my history classes. But the title is what disturbed me and I couldn’t but start reading.The story is marked by umpteen surprises. The suspense is created all through making one get glued to the storyline. The story takes you from Delhi to Harappa to Paris to Banaras.The author wonderfully describes different places. The one description that I could visualize perfectly was that of the city of Varanasi. Vineet makes you have feel of yesteryear civilizations and ghats of Banaras, and not excluding the heritage of Varanasi.The storyline suggests Vidyut’s dying ancestor summoning him to Banaras. The old Brahmin chieftain of the Dev-Raakshasa Matth, or the God-Demon Clan, bears a chilling secret. Their bloodline carries an ancient curse that will plague mankind - towards its own violent extinction. And the rest of the plots are intertwined in this whether it be Harappa, Paris or Rome.What is pathetically unforgiving is the colloquially written dialogues which could have been edited and polished to enhance the standard of the historical thriller. The poor dialogues did hamper the fast pacing and gripping story.But if these are avoided just because the author is trying his hand in this genre for the first time, then the book is commendable. Above all, the research done by the author needs a special mention and to know more, go purchase your copy and travel through Harappa - Curse of the Blood River.",Reviewed in India on 13 October 2017

Harappa sizzles but stumbles","The book is a thrilling read, if you a re a fan of the Amish Tripathi Genre but also want some high drama, this is the book for you.It starts off as slow and awkward but proceeds to gather smooth pace with a few thrilling chases.The Author is pretty passionate about the topic and has done fair research but a few things which stood out as a sore thumb are the stilted dialogues speckled with terms of endearment like “Yaaa” “yAAR” “na” “baby” etc. These dint do justice to the epic characters he tries to build.Speaking of which the books main protagonists are Un-relatable characters– they are far too perfect and infallible to be real, they know everything, they are geniuses and fight like ninjas. It is never clarified what it means to be a devta. What is the origin of a devta? Does it get passed through blood line or reincarnation? Its all left to the readers imaginationThe Author regularly falls in the Trap of telling and not showing; he keeps telling us that this character is evil and this is pure and pious without showing it through dialogue and action.There are a few Point of view issues but it is told like a bollywood script and hence we are never truly aware of whose emotions are getting conveyed.The high point are the very engaging action sequences and the craftily written history of misrepresentation of the Indus valley civilizationThe Author manages to give us all the info-dump through dialogues and never in one go, leaving the reader hungry for more information nuggets. The history and backdrop is efficiently given without boring the reader.",Reviewed in India on 21 October 2017

Harrapa - Tragedy End","Harappa is the story of Vidyut and Vivaswan Pujari – two people separated by three millennia but joined by blood. Both are described as half-devtasThis is a story spanning two timelines, 1700 BCE Harappa and 2017 Banaras, with snippets from various other timelines woven into them.First partVivasvan Pujari, the designated chief priest and demi-God of Harappa, as a result of being grievously betrayed by those he once trusted, is consumed with his desire for revenge.Second partVidyut is living in the 21st century and smokes and drinks – not the traits that we see in Vivaswan. Vidyut is in a live-in relationship and for a very brief moment.Distinction  is a reflection of what is considered godly now versus what was considered godly earlier.There are three key women in Vidyut’s life: Damini; a journalist he is dating; Rhea, his secretary and Naina, who is his long lost childhood friend in Varanasi and an accomplished fighter. All three girls are madly in love with Vidyut. It digressed so much into justification and explanation of historical references that the flow of the book constantly dropped and one just wanted to get done with it instead of enjoying it.",Reviewed in India on 10 February 2019

Could be better.","The good: introduces some fresh ""perspective"" on the  Harrapan civilization. Makes a genuine attempt to focus the Indian reader on their servitude to all things Western.The ok dokie: Ambles too much in the early part of the book. Almost makes you put it down and walk away. Picks up pace towards the end. Clearly driving for a part two, when it may not be required. Too much of Amish in several parts of the story. **The bad: Initially too much back and forth in the timeline without story development. So not only ambles but gets tiresome.The dash of pedestrian Hinglish and some old location names... Gaah!Don't know if this book or the Shiva trilogy is earlier. Whatever the case, too many similarities.Sadly, being ""a completist"", I'll read the part two.  🥺🥺😓",Reviewed in India on 9 July 2019

One time good read","There is some good and bad things about this book. Firstly I am starting with good thing. The story is like a Masala movie, and we like this type of movies because we don't need to use our thoughts very much. We just need to grab popcorn and enjoy it. Thats why I am giving 3 star. But if I talke about bad things there are so many. First the author unnecessarily glorify his characters, which is sometimes very annoying. Secondly he tried to twist the plot so much that sometimes looks like author even lost his way through the plot. And finally I should say he could have revealed some of suspence so readers will wait for the sequel much eagerly.",Reviewed in India on 31 October 2017

Part Good Part Bad","Started well but fell off track midway too much of unnecessary stuff added could have kept it crisp. The climax was apalling it was as if the book was written to be made into a bollywood film. The main character of the novel fighting goons, the typical betrayal by close friend. A bad ending to a book which promised much when I began to read it only to be very badly let down.The author has done a good job narrating the character of vivasan pujari and the old harappa part I wish he could have shown the same deftness for the present day character as well. The pre historic part of the novel was very engaging and it was because of this part that I have given it 3 stars other than that it is nothing but a bollywood potboiler stuff.",Reviewed in India on 11 October 2017
